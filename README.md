The purpose of the analysis is to visualize earthquakes on a map. The map plots earthquakes reported by United States Geological Survey (USGS) on website using Leaflet.js and Mapbox API. The map features:

1) Three layers for all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates
2) Three styles of map (street, satellite, dark)
3) Color codes magnitude of the earthquakes

## Resources
Tools used: HTML, JavaSript, Leaflet.js, Mapbox API

Data sources: [USGS Earthquake GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson) data, [tectonic plate](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates) data from GitHub
